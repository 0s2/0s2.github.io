About: A basic hurricane simulator made for the Hypothetical Hurricanes Wiki. Soon to be more advanced.

v20180712a:
    + Added land, which weakens storms
    * Made tracks thicker
    * Actually added the CSS and version number to make this consistent with my other experiments
    * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks
    * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction
v20180709a:
    + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land
    * Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments
