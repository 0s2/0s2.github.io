About: A basic hurricane simulator made for the Hypothetical Hurricanes Wiki. Soon to be more advanced.

v20180718a:
    + Added names:
        > Depressions recieve a number with the suffix "H" for "Hypothetical"
        > Named storms are all named "Unnamed", as this is incomplete
    + Added code for environment factors such as "shear" and "SSTAnomaly", but are not in use yet
    * Changed each simulation tick from 30 minutes to an hour:
        > Storms now move twice as fast as seen by the viewer, although they move at the same speed in simulation time
        > Strengthening/weakening code is still the same per-tick, so behavior has changed somewhat
    * The time in the upper left uses a slightly different format now
    * Fixed keyboard events blocking default browser actions like "F5" for reload or "F12" for javascript console, except in cases involving keys used for the simulation ("space" doesn't scroll the page down)
v20180713a:
    + Added pausing using "space"
    + Added a date counter; currently serves no purpose
    + Added spawning using the keyboard and mouse:
        > Hold "D" and click to spawn a tropical depression
        > Hold "S" and click to spawn a tropical storm
        > Hold "1" and click to spawn a category 1 hurricane
        > So on for keys "2" through "5"
    + Added stepping one frame (30 sim-minutes) at a time while paused using "A"
    + Added a method to display storms' windspeeds underneath them, enabled using "W"
    * Changed land rendering to better show height
    * Fixed(?) issues involving higher-definition display devices
    * Tracks of dead storms now disappear whenever the framerate drops below 25 fps, not just after their timeout
    * Changed canvas dimensions to 1100x500
    * Tweaked land generation
    % Added moment.js for date and time calculations and display
v20180712a:
    + Added land, which weakens storms
    * Made tracks thicker
    * Actually added the CSS and version number to make this consistent with my other experiments
    * Changed rendering so storm symbols always render above tracks
    * Slight tweak to storm strength calculation besides land interaction
v20180709a:
    + Initially created a simple hurricane simulator without much regard to realism, nor any land
    % Using p5.js for the first time for any of my experiments
